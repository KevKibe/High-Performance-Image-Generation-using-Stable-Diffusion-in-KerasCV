## Description
- This is a [notebook](https://github.com/KevKibe/Implementation-of-Fast-Image-Generation-using-Stable-Diffusion-KerasCV/blob/main/KerasCVstableDiffusion.ipynb) implementation of a Image generation using Stable Diffusion model and KerasCV using textual prompts.
- The goal of this experiment is to compare the traditional technique and using XLA Compilation nad mixed precision support technique which achieves faster generation speed.
- This was done on Kaggle notebooks running a Tesla P100 GPU.

## Findings
-The traditional technique of Image generation took 60 seconds to generate an image and using XLA compilation and mixed precision support took 42 secs on average.
